# Fake-news-detection-using-Deep-Learning
In this project, we used an LSTM-based model to analyze and classify news articles. The data was preprocessed and tokenized before being fed into the LSTM network. Our model achieved an accuracy of approximately 99%, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying fake news.
